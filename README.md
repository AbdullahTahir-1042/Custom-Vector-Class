This C++ project implements a dynamic vector class with a menu-driven interface that allows you to perform various operations on two vectors.

## âœ¨ Features
* Display elements of a vector

* Add and remove elements

* Access elements by index

* Insert element at a specific index

* Remove element at a specific index

* Swap two vectors

* Sort the vector

* Move elements within the vector

* Union and intersection of two vectors

* Store only unique elements

* Count frequency of a specific element

* Check if one vector is a subset of another

* Search for an element

* Add and subtract two vectors

* Compare vectors (==, >, <)

* Exit the program

## ðŸ›  How to Run

* Clone or Download the project.

     Make sure you have a C++ compiler (like g++) installed.

* Compile the project:
   ```
     g++ main.cpp -o VectorProgram

* Run the executable:
  ```bash
     ./VectorProgram


## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
  * main.cpp â€” Contains the menu and program flow.

   * vector.h â€” Contains the Vector class template with all the overloaded operators and functions.


## ðŸ–¥ Program Flow
  * At start, you are prompted to input the size and elements for Vector 1.

  * Menu is displayed repeatedly until you choose to Exit.

  * You can perform various operations by entering the number corresponding to the menu option.

ðŸ“¢ Notes
  * Exception handling is done for invalid index access and operations.

   * Overloaded operators are used for input/output, vector comparisons, addition, and subtraction.
